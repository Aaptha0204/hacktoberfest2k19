#BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS
THE MAIN ISSUE REGARDING THE CODE IS THAT THE RESULTANT PREDUCTION VARIABLE THAT IS YPRED DECLARED 
GIVES RANDOM INDEXES,THE SOLUTION WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE IF IT TAKES THE 0TH-19TH INDEX,

AND ALSO TAKING IN WE ARE TRAINING ON THE 1ST 80% AND AGAIN PREDICTING THE 80% ITSELF,THE SOLUTION WOULD BE
APPROPRIATE IF THE TRAINED MODEL IS USED TO PREDICT THE NEXT 20% WHICH IS NEVER USED IN THE TRAINING.
